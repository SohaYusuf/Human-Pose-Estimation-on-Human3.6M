# Human-Pose-Estimation-on-Human3.6M

In this assignment, we use Human3.6M dataset to train a neural network. Training dataset has 5964 video
samples and test dataset has 1368 video samples. Each video sample has 8 frames each having 224 x
224 x 3 image and we train the model for regression learning with mean-squared error loss. The model
architecture contains CNN (ResNet), LSTM and MLP.
